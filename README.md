GOALS:
  1. Create HTML element with attributes, event listeners and child components/texts; // +++
  2. Update HTML element by diffing trees; // +++
  3. Store with state and dispatching events; // +++
  4. SSR friendly;
  5. Mounted life-cycle method;
  6. Updated life-cycle method
  
  TREE:
  1. type - name of HTML element (for simplicity now);
  2. attrs - attributes of HTML element;
  3. listeners - event listeners of HTML element;
  4. children - another components, or component-convertable, or string-convertable

  DIFFING:
  1. If there's not previous child, insert created element before current position;
  2. If there's not current child, delete element at current position;
  3. If types of trees are different then create new element and replace old one with it;
  4. Otherwise diff attributes/listeners. Change only attributes/listeners which value is changed;
  5. And diff children. Update each child recursively;
  6. If there's specified element (by key) then swap it with previous element

  REQUIREMENTS OF STORE:
